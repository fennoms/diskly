A very simple Discord bot to play songs/YouTube videos in your voice channels

## Motivation
Most Discord bots require some sort of subscription to play songs/videos from YouTube, which is why I have created this simple bot to use with my friends.

## Setup project
The only thing you need to do is create an `.env` file with a singular line containing `DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>`, where `token` is your Discord bot token. If you don't know how to get this, see [Create a bot on Discord](#create-a-bot-on-discord).

## Dependencies
All you need is Docker! Once it is installed, you can use the `script.sh` bash script in order to start the docker container. 

Under the hood, the program uses:

- `Python 3.12`
- `uv` for package management
- `yt_dlp` for extracting youtube information
- `discord.py` for creating bots in Python
